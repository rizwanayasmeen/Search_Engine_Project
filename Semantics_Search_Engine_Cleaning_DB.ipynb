this. it's all my own work it contains almost everything except tea. now young sir what did the police say to you this morning. how do you know about... police hair my dear watson. come and sit down. they were no help i suppose they wouldn't guarantee my father's safety. no i don't altogether blame them. your own police in new york weren't exactly handing out insurance certificate were they no. it's mostly the old boy's fault. he won't let the police look after him their way. you see he's never been afraid of them. and he's not going to begin now. he's not crazy he just feel that way about it. well you see what i'm up against not quite. but i thought you knew... some idea. have an idea who they are probably a gang run by somebody called simister. doe that name mean anything to you it doe indeed. mr campion can you tell me anything about this man simister is he just a gangster a master crook or is it like they say back home a powerful gang using the word a a sort of trade name. doe simister exist somewhere on this earth there is a man called simister. he may be a bogill he may be a devil but he is a real power of evil. i've talked to crook i've talked to the police i've even talked to member of his own gang none of them have every laid eye on the man. he's the voice on the telephone. the shadow on the road. the gloved hand that turn the light in the crook play. but with one big difference. he's never caught. and they say no one ever escape him. why your father it's sort of revenge we think. why well the old boy's been fighting the simister gang all his life. and when the police caught one of them dad gave it him hard not unjust just hard. is that all. well dad won't talk about it. we can only guess. let's have it. i believe that dad ha something definite on the simister gang and i've been trying to figure out what it can be. i hope for both your sake that what you think isn't true. revenge is one thing but if ha a line on these people well... what can i do what can anyone do a fabulous summer spent on hiring mr campion's assistance or a waste of good gold i told you you're my last hope. my dear young optimist what you're saying is here's a nice war come

peppy job i've got on hand at the moment. for how long a fortnight or so. mr wybrow how marvelous you read my dreams. i know what you're thinking. you're wondering where the slow music come in. have heard of judge lobbett we read the paper even here. biddy: the old boy they're always trying to kill. are you in on that albert up to the neck. on the right side of course. he stirred up a hornets' nest in america and now it seems pretty certain they've followed him here. the trouble is he's an infernally tough nut he's not frightened and won't be helped. luckily he's got a bee in his bonnet about folklore ancient english custom that sort of thing. that's really why he's coming he can pretend to be lord of the manor. i shall rely on you vicar for the archeology and what not. relic of witch burning polish up the stock you know the sort of thing. oh i'm just the man for that. anything to do with the devil. oh and he's fond of painting by the way. ours aren't much i'm afraid. oh they look alright and serried rank of ancestors. the main thing is the old bird want to take the place off your hand for 50 a week. seems a bit hard though kicking you out of your own house. no it's wonderful. the dire house is empty we'll move over there. do you expect trouble albert. i don't see how we can escape it. but in a place like this if there are stranger about well we'll know at once. i'll need your help giles. it's about time something happened down here. i'm in it too. oh no biddy no. this is men's work. quite definitely and seriously this is not your sort of show. i am staying or the whole deal is off. the judge ha a daughter hasn't he if she's going to be here so am i. besides what would you three poor fish do without me. saint swithin please bring your influence to bare would you tell her this is no place for the tender sex. in the word of the barn i do remain a neuter although i usually obey biddy. you're making this very awkward. i've never done it... oh don't be a fool you silly old dear. i'm with you to the death you know that. george: well you're a foreigner and therefore it ain't likely you'll be used to our ways. all the same we welcome you. we hope you'll do your best to keep up the old way and do all you can for us. now we'll sing a hymn. oh you come upon me unawares mr campion. i wa saying a few word i'll be going to speak for the visitors. speech of welcome. something like that. me and the rector wa talking you see. he wa all for singing. but me being church warden seemed only right i should do the greeting him being a foreigner. i wouldn't bother with a speech george. aren't there some local custom you know maypolings and whatnot. not give a speech well you know best sir. but maypoling time's passed and pharisee day well that ain't come

anytime. me and my brother henry we make powerful strong owls. especially if our whistle be wetted with some good beer. yes good idea george excellent. but save your breath for whistle wetting time eh you just give me the word. we're the men for you sir. yes i do believe you are. albert i've been looking for you everywhere. we showed them all over the house and they are just charmed about it. son's awfully handsome don't you think you wait until you see me in my new ball gown. jealous i like that painting sir giles. romney isn't it not genuine i'm afraid or it would have been sold. my father called it our faux romney. would you think it very rude of me if i had it authenticated at my expense of course not in the least. i should've had it done age ago. it is a lovely place. i congratulate you mr campion on your choice on our behalf. i hope the child won't find it too quiet. i know you'll all excuse me. you weren't followed i think they were waiting for u in london. but your fellow lugg put them off the scent. yes he ha a genius for misleading people. biddy: we'll leave the place to you now. you'll find mr wybrow ha prepared everything for you. she's a wonderful housekeeper. and you'll come across to the dire house and have dinner with u this evening. oh miss pagett. i'm so glad you're here. thank goodness the judge fell for it. nice old boy rather like the governor only american. same direct way of looking at you and saying exactly what come into his head. boy oh boy what a girl what a girl would you say her eye were blue or brown or a sort of heather mixture gillies... giles giles of course. giles pagett the son of... hubert . hubert hold of the king nine caricades... mmm hmm. ...of land in the hundred of mist mile. yes mist mile wa the old name. even now our creek is full of mist when the rest of the coast is quite clear. there is land for seven plough woodland for 10 swine meadow one league in length for 30 sheep. well if have to do this lord of the manor job i best be off to buy me some swine and sheep. swithin: i can find you a secondhand plough. an owl. did you hear it i wonder what it means. if i'm not very much mistaken it mean a visitor. god bless my soul. mr anthony datchett palmist. not a gate crasher i hope. datchett of course. he's the palmist. a fortune teller now that is interesting. is he a gypsy no sir. it's a gentleman with a big car. he's an extraordinary chap according to guffy randall. go around country house after dinner shilling out the past and future at five bob a time. quite a character. well let's have him in. why not it's always instructive to be told what's going to happen next. mr wybrow: mr datchett. may i introduce myself more fully. my name is anthony datchett i am an itinerant palmist. i should be delighted if one or two of you would consent to let me give a reading. if i do i can promise you one thing... the truth. tell me. certainly. shall we go over there better without an audience if one is to be frank. the only man who told my fortune wa an income tax inspector. did he tell you about owl friday now then child would you like to see a dose of my very own brand of magic gather around. it's called the three card trick or by the common route spot the lady. now then miss which is your money on i say. now then marlowe keep your eye on the card. judge. not a lady spotter in the house. brilliant you know you could make a living with that trick. i did madam i did. i kept a wife and three kiddy in comfort. albert the card wa famous on the race course of britain from ayr to ascot. then one day ala the hand of the law came upon poor happy albert's shoulder and... when i got out of clink it wa albert the upright albert the good a you see him now. what a story are you still married biddy: if you hadn't realised it before mr campion's a habitual and congenital liar. he's quite astounding honestly. biddy you really should get him to tell your fortune. he's an amazing chap. what really got me wa when he told me that i wa thinking of entering a horse for the suffolk show next month. i now that's pretty obvious. but he said i wouldn't send a mare and foal but a hunter instead. what's extraordinary is only the day before yesterday i decided not to send a mare and foal but put oliver in the middle weight hunter class. i haven't told a soul even our groom even biddy. isn't that crazy he's got second sight that man. or he's done his homework rather well. the reverend seems interested alright. doesn't he. i do hope he's promising him lot of adventures. he's led such a good quiet life. giles: i doubt if he'd like that. old swithin's note is tranquility. that seems to be the note of the whole place. what luck did you have oh. i'm too old to have any fortune at all. i must go to bed i know you'll understand. we keep early hour in the country. no please don't get up. good night. good night. it's rather late i'm afraid. i can tell one more fortune. let it be someone to whom i can promise nothing but happiness. will you permit me to tell yours yes. good night my dear. give my love to giles. although you will not marry one of your own people your domain will be wide. and you will know the peace which is the lowing of kine over small meadows. that is your fortune. it is a pity i cannot promise a much to you all. adieu. thank you for coming. a pleasure. you pace your money. sir. alice is in the kitchen. she's brought this from the reverend. giles and campion come over alone. swithin. he wouldn't part with his ring unless it wa important. we best humour him. see what he wants. you know that fellow datchett he also knew my favourite brand of cigars. he's quite extraordinary. but he wa dead right about the hunter... please let go miss biddy i tell ye. stay here alice. he say that giles and mr campion are to go alone. no. let me go in first. all right. string tied to the trigger. it's the usual way. oh god. poor old swithin. campion: who's henry topliss giles: coroner. sorry i couldn't stop her. he shot his self. lord have mercy on his soul. not in his chair. i'll not sit in his chair. the chair of the dead. rector dead. i'll take alice along. she my sister. my wife take care of her. she looked after he so long this ha come like a bit of a shock to her like. goodnight. goodnight. george. don't rouse the village. no sir. mouth shut best at a time like this. what in the name of creation doe it all mean you knew him a well a we did. why would he do such a thing campion: i don't know. i don't know. how horrible. over here all in the dark. well i'd better go and get sergeant peck and the old doc from town then. yes we'll stay here. this wa on the desk next to the letter to the coroner. it's for you. biddy: forgive me and pray for me. my temptation wa great. i succumbed to it. all my love to you my child. tell albert about our longest walk. i mean what wa the temptation why'd he choose such an odd time just after that man wa here albert. that man killed swithin. oh come on now biddy. that nasty little man with the red beard told him something. while we were all listening to giles he said something to make swithin so right out and kill himself. i know it. it's pretty far fetched. do you think he's just an ordinary fortune teller no i don't. i don't think that for a moment. that bird wa up to something fishy. not exercising telepathy. the stuff he told giles wa a pretty bright piece of work. a chap like that could earn a fortune. could that man have come here because of the judge i mean could he actually be the man you told u about simister there's always a chance i suppose. hmm. that's from his best set. poor saint swithin. most have gone potty. i don't think so. i think he's trying to tell u something. what about the longest walk you're supposed to tell me about we've been for so many walks. one day everyone thought we got lost. that must have been the one. tell me. we crossed the stroud and went onto the farther salting. then we turned back. the sky and the water the same colour. when we got back near here this big pool of quicksand. people here call it the soft . that must have been what he meant. danger. biddy my dear child. we all have to die in this wicked world. and i'm not afraid of it at all. but if and when i do if something terrible should happen after my death. come on swithin. you're not going to die. not for year and years. listen. if something terrible should happen i want you to go to see alaric watts. yes i remember him. good. and you promise yes i promise. but what on earth are you talking about no more questions. let's go and have an enormous tea. cream bun and strawberry jam. i'm famished. campion: who's alaric watt biddy: another parson. he wa swithin's best friend. a very keen archaeologist. he's got a parish over by wickham market. but swithin had never heard of the lobbetts then. he had when he wrote this note. and when he sent me this. alice sir giles ha gone for the police and the doctor. i'll wait for him. you go to your beds. i looked after him in life i'll look after him in death. he's old. he wouldn't want nobody but me. goodnight to you. ahh mr campion. it's good of you to come over so late. please help yourself to a drink. i guess you can do with one. yes. yes indeed. this is a terrible business mr campion. terrible terrible bad business. death seems to follow me like gull follow a ship. no i uh... i reckon that you and i ought to understand each other before we go any farther. you see i don't know too much about you. and i feel that i'm following your instruction without knowing why. marlowe engaged you to look after me am i right but you're not a policeman are you hardly no. though recommended i believe. i suggested you come here because i believed you'd be safer here than anywhere. and your family would run le risk. how much do you know in new york they were just trying to frighten you. they didn't know how much you knew but suspected you had a line on them. then i think they realised you had a definite line so they decided to kill you. you escaped. i should say myself that you're very close to knowing the true identity of simister. that you got a clue perhaps from one of the simister gang which you can't quite decipher. well i don't mind telling you that when i first saw you mr campion i thought you were the biggest damn fool ever made. now i'm beginning to wonder if you might not be some sort of telepathy expert like our ginger bearded friend. i've got one end of the string. but if any of that crowd get wind of it my fear is that they'll cut it higher up and i'll lose the one chance of stopping this thing at the head. it's me against simister. that's the way i feel about it and i don't want to involve anyone else. wouldn't one ally be useful no. no one. not my child not the paggett's and not the police. i'm not any of those. i'm an old fool not to welcome your help. but no police. campion: no police. so the inquest's over eh alright. extraordinary. that bit in swithin's letter to the coroner about a malignant and incurable disease. oh swithin wa no more mortally ill than i am. it just wasn't true. i just don't understand. well it is the most common form of delusion. once someone believes... kettle your honour from the shop. morning sir giles miss biddy. i brought your post sir. my daughter said there's his honour the judge going back the manor. why don't you just nip out with his post why i'm very obliged to you sir. oh no sir. it's my pleasure to oblige you and your family sir. we have a nice little shop here. very well stocked. anything you require day or night you just tell me and i'll send it over. well thank you very much mr uh kettle your honour. he seems very obliging. rather an oily fellow. no one in the village can stick him or his daughter. trouble is he's a foreigner. oh i hadn't caught that. oh yes. he come from ipswich. oh well i wonder who would be writing me here. may i of course. oh lord. i forgot all about this. i had written to some people in london about your painting giles. they're sending a man down tomorrow. now i can easily put him off. i would feel ungracious to have him around at a time like this. please don't let this terrible thing make any difference. old swithin never disobliged anyone in his life and i know he'd hate to do it now. of course. biddy's right. yes well. they're sending a man called alistair barber. i know him slightly. albert. what wa the verdict suicide during temporary insanity. did you see the parson alaric watt reverend. yes. nice man. very upset about swithin. that's all. perhaps he had gone potty. either that or the serious trouble hasn't begun yet. what about the red chessman biddy my love. promise me never never ever say anything about the red chessman to anyone. never. promise. i promise. bravo. brilliant albert we won. it's a knack i acquired in china. albert's marvellous. i excel at all vicious games. now where is this maze they tell me about over there. on the other side of the garden. come on. we'll show you. marlowe: albert. i'm sorry dad wrote to that art fellow. rather gave our whereabouts away. alistair barber. yes. oh don't worry. he's quite harmless. though like all expert he talk too much. worse than a movie stars' confessions. judge: this is a fine maze. biddy: we used to have such fun playing here when we were children. is this the entrance that's right do you want to know the key oh no. that would be cheating wouldn't it i'll find my own way. it's not difficult really. my own tour of the maze which our impetuous friend the judge ha missed will be conducted by the world's greatest authority on barratry trigonometry and the kibbo kift. i shall charge a small fee. have you found the centre yet mr lobbett judge: i believe i'm getting that way. judge: i don't believe this maze ha got a middle. are you coming right o. just coming. the key is turn left whenever you can. giles have you found him yet giles: still looking. marlowe: dad mr lobbett giles: mr lobbett keep turning left. funny. look. i'll go back to the centre. you search the blind alleys. you go in marlowe. campion: i wouldn't. leave it to the professionals. mr lobbett can you hear u no sign of him giles. try that false way out from the centre. dad answer me. marlowe: this is crazy. he must be there. there's no other way out is there i don't think so. maze never ha a second door. isopel: he's foxing. he's lost but he won't let on. he's gone albert. he can't have gone. we've searched every inch. it's a if he's disappeared into the ground or something. i knew something like this wa going to happen. they followed u here. i knew we wouldn't be able to get away from them. we've roused the devil. i knew it. i knew it. there's some evil power that's stalking us. it's something we can't escape. please don't disturb yourself. i have an appointment. i say hello oh god. it's that damn picture dealer. so nice to see you again mr lobbett. marlowe: miss pagett. a pleasure miss pagett. alistair ferguson barber. and i don't believe it. my companion from the ship. mr albert. memorial. i never forget a name. slip of the tongue. campion. albert campion. yes. always joking. your father ha asked me to look at a picture for him. i'm afraid that's... judge lobbett isn't available at the moment i'm afraid mr barber. he sends his apologies. if you let me know where you can be contacted i'll telephone you. no. i will wait. i have plenty of time. and what is time in a beautiful place like this this paradise. this is the very soul and spirit of england. when i look around my heart fly up to heaven like the crow. lark. the crow doth sing a sweetly a but not flieth to heaven. look. the cloud of constable. ah where is the painting what painting the painting. the supposed romney. ahh. follow me. what are you doing who are you anyway alistair ferguson barber. i am waiting for judge lobbett. i have a commission from him. and who are you giles pagett. i live here. then i must congratulate you sir giles on your beautiful house and estate. but not i am afraid on the state of your paintings. this one for example. it may be beautiful perhaps even valuable but who can tell under all that grime and varnish. and this fine girtin nearly ruined by the damp. would you please put this painting back where you found it but i must finish my photographing. well finish it then. and then go back to london. i am waiting for judge lobbett. judge lobbett is not here. where is he then i have an appointment. i have it in writing. please do a i say. sir giles... you hope this is by romney eh at the moment i really don't care who painted it. any luck i don't know. look at this. that's the only place anyone could have gotten in or out of the maze bar the entrance. he must have heard u shouting. there's no sign of a struggle. how could anybody get him out of here without making a sound i'll organise a search. on your way. giles: come in please. have you anything to report any of you ha anyone seen anything unusual at all speak up. let's hear about it. none of u ain't seen nothing sir giles. it to be a wonder. maybe a wonder you haven't found him george. he can't have vanished into thin air can he i could find the old gentleman if anybody could. i be wileful smart in searching out anything that be alive. but neither me nor henry nor none of u we ain't seen nothing. i'm afraid the man's right sir giles. i shut up my shop right away and a you know i've been searching ever since. you can depend on it we've done our best. i must have walked 10 miles... yes we know. thank you very much. now. what about boat could someone have got the judge away on a boat henry no sir. my brother wa on his boat all the morning mending nets. if a boat had come he couldn't help but see it. isn't that right henry but when you were off searching. the boy wa there all the time weren't you boy: yeah i wa there. and no mist in the tunnel either. what tunnel it's what they call the creek. there's usually a mist pocket in it. like a bit of a dip in the salting like. misty all day they are. it be a wonderful place for snares. used to be i mean. thank you. all of you. mr wybrow will give you some beer in the barn. off you go. you stay george. this place is more or le an island. the only way out is across the causeway. no one's gone that way. i've had a man on it all the time. i could vouch for that sir. this is the maddest thing i've ever known. i think we should have another look in the creek in case they missed some footprint in the sand. there are plenty of footmark here. none down here. george: wouldn't be though would there why not oh my lord. george: the soft. quicksands. watch any video online with open subtitle free browser extension: osdb.link/ext\""
